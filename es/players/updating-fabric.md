# Updating Fabric

This guide will walk you through updating Fabric for the Minecraft Launcher.

For third party launchers, you should consult their documentation.

Updating Fabric is a very similar process to installing Fabric, so parts of this guide will be the same as the [Installing Fabric](./installing-fabric.md) guide.

## Why should I update Fabric Loader?

Newer mods may require a newer version of Fabric Loader to work, so it's important to keep it up to date to ensure you can use the latest mods.

<!-- Include steps from installing guide, no need to repeat them. -->
<!--@include: ./installing-fabric.md{12,41}-->

To update Fabric, simply ensure the game version and loader version is correct then click `Install`.

**Make sure to uncheck 'Create Profile' when running the installer, otherwise it will create a new profile, which in this case, we don't need.**

## 3. Open the Profile in the Minecraft Launcher

Once the installer has finished, you can open the Minecraft Launcher and go to the `Installations` tab. You should go to your Fabric profile and open the edit screen.

Replace the version with the new version of Fabric Loader you just installed, and press `Save`.

## 4. You're done!

Once you've completed the steps you can go back to the `Play` tab, select the Fabric profile from the dropdown in the bottom left corner and press play!

If you encounter any issues whilst following this guide, you can ask for help in the [Fabric Discord](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv) in the `#player-support` channel.
