# Third-Party Tools {#third-party-tools}

This section of the Fabric Documentation is dedicated to players and server administrators who want to learn how to use Fabric with third-party tools such as modpack launchers and server software.

You should refer to the sidebar for a list of all the guides available.

If you encounter any issues, please report them [on GitHub](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-docs) or ask for help on the [Fabric Discord](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv) in the `#player-support` or `#server-admin-support` channels.

Alternatively, you should also ask in the relevant communication channels for these third-party tools - as they are more likely to have the information you need.
