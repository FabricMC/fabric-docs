# Fabric with Prism Launcher {#fabric-with-prism-launcher}

Prism Launcher is a modpack launcher that supports Fabric mods and modpacks. This page will guide you through the process of installing Fabric and adding Fabric mods and modpacks with Prism Launcher.

## Installing Fabric {#installing-fabric}

First, click on the `Add Instance` button at the top of the Prism Launcher window. This should open the `Add Instance` window.

You should select the Minecraft version you want to install Fabric for, and then clicking `Fabric` in the `Mod Loader` list. It's recommended to choose the latest stable version of Fabric Loader, which is indicated with a star:

Once you've selected your Minecraft version and Fabric Loader version, click `Okay`. The Prism Launcher will download and install Fabric Loader for you and create a profile for it.

## Installing Fabric Mods {#installing-fabric-mods}

You will first need to select your instance from the list of instances in the Prism Launcher window and click `Edit` on the sidebar - this will open the `Console Window` for your instance.

In the `Console Window`, click on the `Mods` tab. You can then either click `Add Mod` to add a jar mod file from your computer, or `Download Mods` to download mods from either Modrinth or CurseForge.

::: tip
Using `Download Mods` allows Prism Launcher to notify you when mods have updates, and allow you to automatically update the mods without needing to manually uninstall and reinstall them.
