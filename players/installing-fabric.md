# Installing Fabric

This guide will walk you through installing Fabric for the Minecraft Launcher.

For third party launchers, you should consult their documentation.

## 1. Download the Fabric Installer

You can download the Fabric Installer from the [Fabric Website](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

For windows, it's recommended you download the `.exe` version (`Download For Windows`), as it doesn't require java to be installed on your system (it will use the java installation that comes with the Minecraft Launcher).

For macOS and Linux, you should download the `.jar` version, this may mean you need to install java firstly though.

## 2. Run the Fabric Installer

::: warning
Before running the installer, you must close the Minecraft Launcher if it is running, along with any other Minecraft instances that are currently running.

**You must also ensure that you have played the version of Minecraft you want to use Fabric for at least once, otherwise the installer will not be able to find the version's files.**
:::

Once you've opened the installer, you should see a screen like this:

To install Fabric, simply choose your game version from the dropdown, and click `Install`.

**You should make sure that 'Create Profile' is checked, otherwise the installer will not create a profile for you.**

## 3. You're done!

Once the installer has finished, you can open the Minecraft Launcher and select the Fabric profile from the dropdown in the bottom left corner and press play!
