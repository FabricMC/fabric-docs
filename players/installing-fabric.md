# Installing Fabric

This guide will walk you through installing Fabric for the official Minecraft Launcher.

For third party launchers, you should consult their documentation.

## 1. Download the Fabric Installer

You can download the Fabric Installer from the [Fabric Website](https://fabricmc.net/use/).

If you use Windows, download the `.exe` version (`Download For Windows`), because it doesn't require Java to be installed on your system. It instead uses Java that came with the official launcher.

For macOS and Linux, you should download the `.jar` version. Sometimes, you need to install Java before this step.

## 2. Run the Fabric Installer

::: warning
Close Minecraft and the Minecraft Launcher first before installing.
:::

::: details Information for MacOS users

On macOS, you may need to right click the `.jar` file in your downloads directory and click `Open` to run it.

When asked "Are you sure you want to open it?", click `Open` again.

Once you've opened the installer, you should see a screen like this:

**Make sure that 'Create Profile' is checked.**  

## 3. You're done!

Once the installer has finished, you can open the Minecraft Launcher and select the Fabric profile from the dropdown in the bottom left corner and press Play!
