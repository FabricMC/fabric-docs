## 1. Download the Fabric Installer {#1-download-the-fabric-installer}

Download the `.exe` version of the Fabric Installer from the [Fabric Website](https://fabricmc.net/use/), by clicking on `Download for Windows`.

::: tip

The `.exe` version for Windows does not require Java to be installed, because it uses the Java bundled with the official Minecraft Launcher.

:::

## 2. Run the Fabric Installer {#2-run-the-fabric-installer}

Close Minecraft and the Minecraft Launcher first before running the installer.

Once you open the installer, you should see a screen like this:

Select your desired Minecraft version and click `Install`. Make sure that `Create Profile` is checked.

## 3. Finish Setup {#3-finish-setup}

Once installation completes, open the Minecraft Launcher. Then select the Fabric profile from the version dropdown and click Play.

You can now add mods to your game. See the [Finding Trustworthy Mods](../finding-mods) guide for info.
