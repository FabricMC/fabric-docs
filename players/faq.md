# Frequently Asked Questions

There are a lot of questions that are asked frequently, so weâ€™ve compiled a list of them here, alongside their answers, to help you out, and to reduce the amount of times we have to answer them, so we can focus on more important things, like making Fabric better.

## General Questions

### What Minecraft versions does Fabric support?

Fabric supports all versions of Minecraft starting from snapshots `18w43b` and above, and releases `1.14` and above.

### Where can I download published Fabric Mods?

::: info
You should always check if mods are from a trustworthy source, checkout the [Finding Mods](./finding-mods.md) guide for more information.
:::

The majority of authors publish their mods to [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mods?g=categories:%27fabric%27) and [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/search?page=1&pageSize=20&sortType=1&class=mc-mods&gameFlavorsIds=4), however some may choose to upload it on their personal websites, or on other platforms, such as a GitHub repository.

### Where can I find premade Fabric modpacks?

You can find premade Fabric modpacks on a variety of platforms, such as:

- [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/modpacks?g=categories:%27fabric%27)
- [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/search?page=1&pageSize=20&sortType=1&class=modpacks&gameFlavorsIds=4)
- [Feed The Beast](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/ftb-app)

## Interoperability Questions

### Do Fabric mods work with Forge mods?

No. **Fabric mods do not work on Forge.**

The development team does not consider Forge interoperability a high-priority goal, as our focus in our limited time dedicated to the project is on supporting the Fabric community and its developers and users.

::: info
Whilst there have been [some unofficial attempts](https://github.com/Sinytra/Connector) to make Fabric and Forge work together, they are not officially supported, and we do not recommend using them.
:::

## Can Fabric run together with Bukkit/Spigot/Paper?

No, and it is unlikely to be officially supported. This is due to many core differences between Fabric and Bukkit/Spigot/Paper.
