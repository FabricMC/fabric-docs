# Installing Java on Linux {#installing-java-on-linux}

This guide will walk you through installing Java 21 on Linux.

## 1. Check if Java Is Already Installed {#1-check-if-java-is-already-installed}

Open a terminal, type `java -version`, and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.

::: warning
To use Minecraft 1.21, you'll need at least Java 21 installed. If this command displays any version lower than 21, you'll need to update your existing Java installation.

## 2. Downloading and Installing Java 21 {#2-downloading-and-installing-java}

We recommend using OpenJDK 21, which is available for most Linux distributions.

### Arch Linux {#arch-linux}

::: info
For more information on installing Java on Arch Linux, see the [Arch Linux Wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Java).
:::

You can install the latest JRE from the official repositories:

```sh
sudo pacman -S jre-openjdk
```

If you're running a server without the need for a graphical interface, you can install the headless version instead:

```sh
sudo pacman -S jre-openjdk-headless
```

If you plan to develop mods, you'll need the JDK instead:

```sh
sudo pacman -S jdk-openjdk
```

### Debian/Ubuntu {#debian-ubuntu}

You can install Java 21 using `apt` with the following commands:

```sh
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-21-jdk
```

### Fedora {#fedora}

You can install Java 21 using `dnf` with the following commands:

```sh
sudo dnf install java-21-openjdk
```

If you don't need a graphical interface, you can install the headless version instead:

```sh
sudo dnf install java-21-openjdk-headless
```

If you plan to develop mods, you'll need the JDK instead:

```sh
sudo dnf install java-21-openjdk-devel
```

### Other Linux Distributions {#other-linux-distributions}

If your distribution isn't listed above, you can download the latest JRE from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/)

You should refer to an alternative guide for your distribution if you plan to develop mods.

## 3. Verify That Java 21 Is Installed {#3-verify-that-java-is-installed}

Once the installation is complete, you can verify that Java 21 is installed by opening a terminal and typing `java -version`.

If the command runs successfully, you will see something like shown before, where the Java version is displayed:
