# Installing Mods {#installing-mods}

This guide will walk you through installing mods for Fabric using the Minecraft Launcher.

For third party launchers, you should consult their documentation.

## 1. Download the Mod {#1-download-the-mod}

::: warning
You should only download mods from sources you trust. For more information on finding mods, see the [Finding Trustworthy Mods](./finding-mods) guide.
:::

The majority of mods require Fabric API as well, which can be downloaded from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) or [CurseForge](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api).

When downloading mods, ensure that:

- They work on the version of Minecraft you want to play on. A mod that works on version 1.20, for example, might not work on version 1.20.2.
- They are for Fabric and not another mod loader.
- Furthermore, they are for the correct edition of Minecraft (Java Edition).

## 2. Move the Mod to the `mods` Folder {#2-move-the-mod-to-the-mods-folder}

The mods folder can be found in the following locations for each operating system.

You can usually paste these paths into the address bar of your file explorer to quickly navigate to the folder.

```:no-line-numbers [Windows]
%appdata%\.minecraft\mods
```

```:no-line-numbers [macOS]
~/Library/Application Support/minecraft/mods
```

```:no-line-numbers [Linux]
~/.minecraft/mods
```

:::

Once you've found the `mods` folder, you can move the mod `.jar` files into it.

Once you've moved the mods into the `mods` folder, you can open the Minecraft Launcher and select the Fabric profile from the dropdown in the bottom left corner and press play!
