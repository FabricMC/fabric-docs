# Rendering in the Hud {#rendering-in-the-hud}

We already briefly touched on rendering things to the hud in the [Basic Rendering Concepts](./basic-concepts) page and [Using The Drawing Context](./draw-context), so on this page we'll stick to the `HudRenderCallback` event and the `tickDelta` parameter.

## HudRenderCallback {#hudrendercallback}

The `HudRenderCallback` event - provided by Fabric API - is called every frame, and is used to render things to the HUD.

To register to this event, you can simply call `HudRenderCallback.EVENT.register` and pass in a lambda that takes a `DrawContext` and a `RenderTickCounter` instance as parameters.

The draw context can be used to access the various rendering utilities provided by the game, and access the raw matrix stack.

You should check out the [Draw Context](./draw-context) page to learn more about the draw context.

### Render Tick Counter {#render-tick-counter}

The `RenderTickCounter` class allows you to retrieve the current `tickDelta` value.

`tickDelta` is the "progress" between the last game tick and the next game tick.

For example, if we assume a 200 FPS scenario, the game runs a new tick roughly every 10 frames. Each frame, `tickDelta` represents how far we are between the last tick and the next. Over 10 frames, you might see:

| Frame | tickDelta                                    |
|-------|----------------------------------------------|
| 1     | `1.0` (new tick)                             |
| 2     | `0.11 (1÷9)` - The next tick is in 9 frames. |
| 3     | `0.22 (2÷9)`                                 |
| 4     | `0.33 (3÷9)`                                 |
| 5     | `0.44 (4÷9)`                                 |
| 6     | `0.55 (5÷9)`                                 |
| 7     | `0.66 (6÷9)`                                 |
| 8     | `0.77 (7÷9)`                                 |
| 9     | `0.88 (8÷9)`                                 |
| 10    | `1.0 (9÷9)` (new tick)                       |

Practically, you should only use `tickDelta` when your animations depend on Minecraft's ticks. For time-based animations, use `Util.getMeasuringTimeMs()`, which measures real-world time.

You can retrieve `tickDelta` using the `renderTickCounter.getTickDelta(false);` function, where the boolean parameter is `ignoreFreeze`, which essentially just allows you to ignore whenever players use the `/tick freeze` command.

In this example, we'll use `Util.getMeasuringTimeMs()` to linearly interpolate the color of a square that is being rendered to the HUD.

Why don't you try use `tickDelta` and see what happens to the animation when you run the `/tick freeze` command? You should see the animation freeze in place as `tickDelta` becomes constant (assuming you have passed `false` as the parameter to `RenderTickCounter#getTickDelta`)
