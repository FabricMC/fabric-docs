## Fact check

- **Conditions** are evaluated by criteria ([Advancements](./advancements))
- `Conditions` has a `playerPredicate` field. All `Conditions` should have a player predicate (technically a `LootContextPredicate`) ([Advancements](./advancements))

## Missing

- Datagen for custom recipe types ([Recipes](./recipes))
- `LootPoolEntry`s need more detail ([Loot Tables](./loot-tables))
- Chest loot needs an example of how to use it or test it. This could come with a screenshot. ([Loot Tables](./loot-tables))
- Entity loot needs to be done. ([Loot Tables](./loot-tables))
