Tools are essential for survival and progression, allowing players to gather resources, construct buildings, and defend themselves.

## Creating a Tool Material {#creating-a-tool-material}

You can create a tool material by instantiating a new `ToolMaterial` object and storing it in a field that can be used later to create the tool items that use the material.

@[code transcludeWith=:::guidite_tool_material](@/reference/latest/src/main/java/com/example/docs/item/ModItems.java)

The `ToolMaterial` constructor accepts the following parameters, in this specific order:

| Parameter | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `incorrectBlocksForDrops` | If a block is in the incorrectBlocksForDrops tag, it means that when you use a tool made from this `ToolMaterial` on that block, the block will not drop any items. |
| `durability` | The durability of all tools that are of this `ToolMaterial`.  |
| `speed` | The mining speed of the tools that are of this `ToolMaterial`. |
| `attackDamageBonus` | The additional attack damage of the tools that are of this `ToolMaterial` will have. |
| `enchantmentValue` | The "Enchantability" of tools which are of this `ToolMaterial`. |
| `repairItems` | Any items within this tag can be used to repair tools of this `ToolMaterial` in an anvil. |

If you're struggling to determine balanced values for any of the numerical parameters, you should consider looking at the vanilla tool material constants, such as `ToolMaterial.STONE` or `ToolMaterial.DIAMOND`.

## Creating Tool Items {#creating-tool-items}

Using the same utility function as in the [Creating Your First Item](./first-item) guide, you can create your tool items:

@[code transcludeWith=:::7](@/reference/latest/src/main/java/com/example/docs/item/ModItems.java)

The two float values (`1f, 1f`) refer to the attack damage of the tool and the attack speed of the tool respectively.

Remember to add them to an item group if you want to access them from the creative inventory!

@[code transcludeWith=:::8](@/reference/latest/src/main/java/com/example/docs/item/ModItems.java)

You will also have to add a texture, item translation and item model. However, for the item model, you'll want to use the `item/handheld` model as your parent instead of the usual `item/generated`.

For this example, I will be using the following model and texture for the "Guidite Sword" item:

@[code](@/reference/latest/src/main/generated/assets/fabric-docs-reference/models/item/guidite_sword.json)

<DownloadEntry visualURL="/assets/develop/items/tools_0.png" downloadURL="/assets/develop/items/tools_0_small.png">Texture</DownloadEntry>

That's pretty much it! If you go in-game you should see your tool item(s) in the tools tab of the creative inventory menu.
