Creative Tabs, also known as Item Groups, are the tabs in the creative inventory that store items. You can create your own creative tab to store your items in a separate tab. This is pretty useful if your mod adds a lot of items and you want to keep them organized in one location for your players to easily access.

## Creating the Creative Tab {#creating-the-creative-tab}

Adding a creative tab is pretty simple. Simply create a new static final field in your items class to store the creative tab and a resource key for it. You can then use `FabricItemGroup.builder` to create the tab and add items to it:

@[code transcludeWith=:::9](@/reference/latest/src/main/java/com/example/docs/item/ModItems.java)

@[code transcludeWith=:::\_12](@/reference/latest/src/main/java/com/example/docs/item/ModItems.java)

You should see a new tab is now in the creative inventory menu. However, it is untranslated - you must add a translation key to your translations file - similarly to how you translated your first item.

## Adding a Translation Key {#adding-a-translation-key}

If you used `Component.translatable` for the `title` method of the creative tab builder, you will need to add the translation to your language file.

```json
{
  "itemGroup.example-mod": "Example Mod"
}
```

Now, as you can see, the creative tab should be correctly named:
