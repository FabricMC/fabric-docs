In IntelliJ IDEA, open the Gradle tab on the right and execute `build` under tasks. The JARs should appear in the `build/libs` folder in your project directory. Use the JAR file with the shortest name outside development.

## Installing and Sharing {#installing-and-sharing}

From there, the mod can be [installed as normal](../../players/installing-mods), or uploaded to trustworthy mod hosting sites like [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft) and [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/discover/mods).
