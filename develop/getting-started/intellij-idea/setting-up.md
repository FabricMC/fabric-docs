## Installing "Minecraft Development" Plugin {#installing-idea-plugins}

The Minecraft Development plugin provides support for modding with Fabric, and it is the most important plugin to install.

::: tip
Although this plugin isn't strictly necessary, it can make modding with Fabric much easier - you should consider installing it.
:::

You can install it by opening IntelliJ IDEA, and then navigating to **File** > **Settings** > **Plugins** > **Marketplace** tab, then search for `Minecraft Development` in the search bar, and click the **Install** button.

Alternatively, you can download it from the [plugin page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8327-minecraft-development) and then install it by navigating to **File** > **Settings** > **Plugins** > **Install Plugin From Disk**.
