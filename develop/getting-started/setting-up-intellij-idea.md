## Installing IntelliJ IDEA {#installing-intellij-idea}

If you do not have IntelliJ IDEA installed, you can download it from the [official website](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/) - follow the installation steps for your operating system.

The Community edition of IntelliJ IDEA is free and open-source, and it is the recommended version for modding with Fabric.

You may have to scroll down to find the Community edition download link - it looks like the following:

## Installing IDEA Plugins {#installing-idea-plugins}

Although these plugins aren't strictly necessary, they can make modding with Fabric much easier - you should consider installing them.

### Minecraft Development {#minecraft-development}

The Minecraft Development plugin provides support for modding with Fabric, and it is the most important plugin to install.

You can install it by opening IntelliJ IDEA, and then navigating to `File > Settings > Plugins > Marketplace Tab` - search for `Minecraft Development` in the search bar, and then click the `Install` button.

Alternatively, you can download it from the [plugin page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/8327-minecraft-development) and then install it by navigating to `File > Settings > Plugins > Install Plugin From Disk`.
