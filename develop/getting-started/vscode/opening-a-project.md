Assuming you already have a project, you can open it through **File** > **Open Folder**.

![File Open](/assets/develop/getting-started/vscode/file-open.png)

Then select the relevant folder from the folder picker.

![Open Folder](/assets/develop/getting-started/vscode/open-folder.png)

You should see an indicator and a notification of the project import progress.
