::: warning IMPORTANT
While it is possible to develop mods using Visual Studio Code, we recommend against it.
Consider using [IntelliJ IDEA](../intellij-idea/setting-up), which has dedicated Java tooling, advanced features and useful community-created plugins such as **Minecraft Development**.
:::

::: info PREREQUISITES
Make sure you've [installed a JDK](../setting-up#install-jdk-21) first.

## Installation {#installation}

You can download Visual Studio Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or through your preferred package manager.

## Prerequisites {#prerequisites}

Visual Studio Code does not provide Java language support out of the box. However, Microsoft provides a convenient extension pack that contains all the necessary extensions to enable Java language support.

You can install this extension pack from [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack).

Or, within Visual Studio Code itself, through the Extensions view.

The **Language Support for Java** extension will present you with a startup screen to set up a JDK. You can do so if you have not already.
