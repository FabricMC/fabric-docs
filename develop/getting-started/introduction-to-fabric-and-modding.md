# Introduction To Fabric And Modding

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you should have a basic understanding of developing with Java, and an understanding of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

If you are unfamiliar with these concepts, you may want to look into some tutorials on Java and OOP before you start modding, here are some of the resources that you can use to learn Java and OOP:

- [W3: Java Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/java/)
- [Codecademy: Learn Java](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java)
- [W3: Java OOP](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_oop.asp)
- [Medium: Introduction to OOP](https://medium.com/@Adekola_Olawale/beginners-guide-to-object-oriented-programming-a94601ea2fbd)

## What Is Fabric?

Fabric is a lightweight modding toolchain for Minecraft: Java Edition. 

It is designed to be a simple and easy-to-use modding platform that is compatible with other modding tools and libraries. 

For developers, you should be aware of these four main components:

- **Fabric Loader**: A flexible platform-independent mod loader designed for Minecraft and other games and applications.
- **Fabric Loom**: A Gradle plugin enabling developers to easily develop and debug mods.
- **Fabric API**: A set of APIs and tools for mod developers to use when creating mods.
- **Yarn**: A set of open Minecraft mappings, free for everyone to use under the Creative Commons Zero license.

## Why is Fabric necessary to mod Minecraft?

> Modding is the process of modifying a game in order to change its behavior or add new features - in the case of Minecraft, this can be anything from adding new items, blocks, or entities, to changing the game's mechanics or adding new game modes.

Minecraft: Java Edition is obfuscated by Mojang, making modification alone difficult. However, with the help of modding tools like Fabric, modding becomes much easier - this is where Yarn, or other mapping projects, come in. 

Yarn maps the obfuscated code to a human-readable format, making it easier for modders to understand and modify the game's code - it's crucial for modding to be possible.
